## Network Malware Detection Analysis with PySpark

This project analyzes network traffic data for malware detection purposes using Apache Spark and its Python API (PySpark). The data originates from the Kaggle dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/network-malware-detection-connection-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/network-malware-detection-connection-analysis)

### Key Concepts

* **Apache Spark:** Unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
* **PySpark:** Python API for Spark, enabling programmatic interaction with Spark from Python.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial investigation to understand the data's characteristics.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for further analysis.
* **Data Quality Checks:** Ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data.
* **Time Series Plots:** Visualizations that depict data points over time, often used to identify trends and patterns.
* **Plotly:** Python library for creating interactive web-based visualizations.

### Project Structure
